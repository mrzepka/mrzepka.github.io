		<div id="about">
			<p>Hello!  I am currently a rising Senior at the University of Maryland, College Park.  I'm pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science (expected 2015).  <br>
			I enjoy photography, travelling, playing video games, and long walks on the beach.  I have a minor in GIS (Geographic Information Science). Working with <br>
			maps and image analysis as well as some light scripting to manage maps I wanted to be more well rounded in my abilities as a programmer. <br>
			I'm always willing to learn and expand my skill set.
			</p>
			<p>By making this site I hope to familiarize myself with the process of web development from scratch. <br>
			By throwing myself in the deep end and trying to learn how to swim I can come up with a nice platform to learn as much as I can <br>
			in a way that interests me, and can reflect my skills as a developer.
			</p>
